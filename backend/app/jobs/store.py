"""In-memory job store with SSE fan-out and TTL eviction.

All state-mutating methods are guarded by an internal re-entrant lock.
The Python-asyncio threading model means simple dict/list ops are
already atomic within a single coroutine, but ``_evict_stale`` and
``_remove_job`` straddle several mutations, and a future move to
threading or to multiprocessing (with shared state) would expose the
fragility. ``threading.RLock`` is the cheap defensive choice — sync
callers see no API change, async callers don't have to ``await`` the
lock, and re-entrancy avoids self-deadlocks when (for example)
``create_job`` calls ``_evict_stale``.
