"""HTTP-layer DTOs.

These Pydantic models describe request/response payloads exchanged with
the FastAPI server and the SSE stream. They are intentionally NOT in
``saknussemm.core.schemas`` because the pure correction pipeline doesn't
speak HTTP — only the server does. See ARCHITECTURE.md §3.2.

When the eventual `alto-server` package is extracted, this
file moves there verbatim.
