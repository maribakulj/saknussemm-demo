"""Characterization snapshot of the /diff and /layout read-model
projections (audit — filet for audit Problems 4 and 9).

Problem 4: ``api/jobs.py`` is a 498-line router that inlines the /diff and
/layout manifest→JSON projections. A later slice will lift them into pure
functions in a read-model module. This test pins their *exact output
shape* on a small deterministic corpus (``examples/sample.xml``, 2 pages /
10 lines / 3 blocks) by calling the endpoint functions directly with a
hand-built ``JobManifest`` — no HTTP, no job store. After the Phase-5
extraction, the pure functions must reproduce this shape byte-for-byte.

Problem 9: the projections read ``job.document_manifest.pages`` only —
never the per-line trace. The redundant ``line_traces`` field was deleted
by an earlier slice; this test asserts it is gone and that full /diff and /layout
output is still produced without it.
